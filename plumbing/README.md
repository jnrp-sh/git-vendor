# 🚽 Plumbing Commands

*...and libraries!*

> [!NOTE]
> The term *plumbing* is [borrowed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Internals-Plumbing-and-Porcelain) from Git itself!

## Motivation

The [`git-vendor`](/) project primarily provides library and application alternatives to Git submodules and subtrees.
To accomplish this, some lower-level *plumbing* libraries and applications (Git commands) are needed.
Such libraries are developed here.
While all are available for use by end-users, their use is not required to benefit from the `git-vendor` library or application.
